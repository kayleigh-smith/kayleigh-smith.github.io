## Research Interests

I am currently a PhD student in social psychology at the University of Edinburgh. My research interests include:

-   Intra- and inter-group processes

-   Crowd psychology

-   Event safety management

My PhD project explores the relationships between football fans and their clubs. I investigate how the Social Identity Approach to Leadership applies within these relationships, how football clubs can communicate themselves as identity leaders, and the implications of these relationships on spectator feelings of safety and experience at events.
