## About 

I am current a PhD student in social psychology at the University of Edinburgh. My research interests include: 
* Intra- and inter-group processes
* Crowd psychology
* Event safety management 

My PhD research explores the relationships between football fans and their clubs. I investigate how the Social Identity Approach to Leadership applies within these relationships, how football clubs can communicate themselves as identity leaders, and the implications of this on spectator safety and experience at events.
