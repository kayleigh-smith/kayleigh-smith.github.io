> "Kayleigh was GREAT. She took the time to go through every quiz answer with me which was so helpful to see where I went wrong and she never made me feel dumb or bad for being behind sometimes or getting things wrong. She was really supportive and understanding and really tried to give me confidence in my abilities. She let me work through things I found difficult and guided me through finding the answer for myself, and helped me really understand things I was struggling with. She was very slay, 10/10 really really recommend"
